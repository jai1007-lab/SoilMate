      <h2>Ajay Gandhi – A tribute</h2>
      <h5> Dec 7, 2021</h5>
      <img src="images/blog6.jpg" style="height:200px;"></img> <br> <br>
      <p>For Hyderabadis Ajay Gandhi has been an integral part of the intellectual corridors of the our city’s architecture. With his very untimely passing on 23rd September the city has lost one of the pearls that decorated the intellectual, literary, social and business circles of Hyderabad. It would be unfair to say that his influence was confined to Hyderabad. It had a meaning for many beyond the confines of the city.
         Ever since Manthan was started by Ajay Gandhi and Vikram about 15 years back it has brought the beauty of a healthy public debate to the people of Hyderabad. We had the privilege of listening to many great minds and absorbing those ideas. Sometimes controversial topics were handled with ease and elan. I remember getting a call from him in 2010 requesting me to debate about GM crops with Dr Pushpa Bhargava on the Manthan platform. It was not easy for me to accept the invitation for a one on one debate since Bt Brinjal was just put on an indefinite moratorium by the then Environment Minister Shri Jairam Ramesh and Dr Bhargava was one of crusaders against the use of GM technology in crops. Apart from my own deep conviction in the technology what motivated me to do this was Ajay Gandhi’s persuasive skills. The way he monitored the progress of this public debate and brought it to a very constructive and peaceful end was remarkable and spoke highly of his capabilities.
         The annual Samvad on 2nd October is another occasion which I rarely missed. The intellectuals who spoke at Manthan or at Samvad were encouraged to be open and fearless in expressing their opinions which made them very rich in content and in shaping public thought. It must have needed a huge effort on the part of Ajay Gandhi and Vikram to organize these talks and debates initially. But once it took off these events became very renowned platforms for public debates. Hyderabad Literary Festival is another annual event that we all looked forward to. At a time when the digital media has taken over our lives a physical event that brought out the flavours of literature in multiple languages has been like a breath of fresh air in the lovely January weather of Hyderabad every year.  Every one enjoyed those few days and reconnected with the glorious past, the thrilling present and the anticipated future of our rich literary wealth.

      <h2>Decluttering the new farm laws</h2>
      <h5> Sep 2, 2021</h5>
      <img src="images/blog7.jpg" style="height:200px;"></img> <br> <br>
      <p>The agricultural marketing reforms brought about by the government through two new laws and an amendment to the existing Essential Commodities Act are in the right direction. Farmer has been shackled through mandated selling of his produce through the APMC mandis which made his price discovery poor and his profits low. The current reforms give them freedom.

The protests we are witnessing are due to many reasons like lack of consensus building efforts by the government before bringing the laws, misinformation campaign being carried out by vested interests which is misleading the farmers, politicization of issue and resistance to change and reluctance of farmers, middlemen and state governments to move from their comfort zones. Many states have made tremendous progress with modification of their APMC laws in the last five years and they should find the new reforms a logical extension of what they have been trying to do.<br>

<h4>Farm Reforms explained</h4>

Here is an effort to explain the new laws in simple language so that the issues are decluttered. <br>
<h5>Essential Commodities Act </h5>amended to remove restrictions on the stock holding levels of agricultural commodities with farmers, processors, exporters and traders. It is estimated that annually we lose about Rs. 90,000 cr worth agricultural production in post harvest losses. This amendment will help private sector invest in creating modern storge systems, processing facilities and reduce these losses. Farmers gain by storing their produce in warehouses and accessing credit against the stored produce through the warehouse receipt systems on digital platforms. So, this should be welcomed by the farmers.

      <h2>Balancing between lockdown and agricultural growth</h2>
      <h5> Aug 7, 2021</h5>
      <img src="images/blog8.jpg" style="height:200px;"></img> <br> <br>
      <p>The government is obviously doing a great job of the fight against COVID-19 virus. This is an unprecedented challenge for the country and all of us have to work hard to strengthen the hands of the government. Lock Down is a very important component of the strategy and there is not much choice for the government on that front.
         Lock down has its impact on the economic growth of the country, especially in the field of agriculture. Farmers play a key role in providing food supplies to the population during and after the lock down. Hence he is a very important warrior who provides us food security during this crisis time.
         The first challenge for the farmers is harvesting of the Rabi crops like Wheat, Rice, Pulses, Mustard, Maize, Fruits and Vegetables followed by the task of selling them. Due to non-availability of labour harvesting has come under severe stress. The market linkage for the farmer is broken due to lack of transportation and markets. He is not able to sell what he has managed to harvest. This has to be fixed first so that the farmer has enough cash in hand which helps him to clear his debts, support his family and plan for Kharif crop. Also to ensure continuous supply of food to the population.
         In spite of the best intentions of the Government, opening all the Mandis and making them operational is not an easy task. Providing warehousing facility for the farmer within his village is another challenge. The Government needs to look at supporting established digital platforms to scale up on an emergency basis and provide an outlet for the farmers rabi produce immediately. Some of these platforms have been doing a good job in the last few years. However they need a big push from the Government in a crisis situation like this so that they can provide new solutions to the farmers.
         As a long term measure Government has to build storage facilities in villages which farmers can use to store the output and also get finance against ware house receipts. Encouraging private investment in village level warehousing and in purchase of agricultural output directly from farmers or FPOs is a much needed reform.
